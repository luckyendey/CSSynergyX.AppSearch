## How to Use

Once the addon is installed, you can start using the search functionality as follows:

1. **Enter Search Query:**
   - Type the name or part of the name of the application you are looking for in the search box.
   - Even if you type the words in the wrong order and typo, the search will still work (e.g., "nw requset" for "Request New").
   - Since the the "Settings" application is present in almost every module, you can also type a combination of module name, menu tab, group, and application name (e.g., type "system dtap setting" to find the Settings application under "Modules -> System -> Setup -> DTAP Management - Settings").

1. **View Results:**
   - As you type, the search box will display a list of matching applications.
   - Click on an application from the search results to be redirected to its details page.
